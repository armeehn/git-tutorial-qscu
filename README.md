# A Tutorial on Git, presented by the Quantitative Science Course Union (QSCU)

Welcome to the `git` tutorial!

This README file contains a listing of all that we'll cover today.
And instead of a _just_ presentation-style approach, we're going to get our hands a little dirty...

First, we'll cover the basics

1. Creating your first, ever repository!
2. Editing a file that we're created for you
3. Commiting your first change (we knew you could do it!)
4. Pushing those changes to a remote server
5. Reverting changes (i.e. "oops...")

Then, we'll move onto some extras

1. Stashing changes temporarily
2. Branching to try something out
3. Merging a branch into another one

Lastly, we'll discuss some tips and tricks
- How to write a good commit message
- Keeping your workspace organized!
- Where to learn more, troubleshoot
- GitHub Student Developer Pack

Thank you for your attendance!
